# game (not the definitive name, as you might have guessed)

## What is it ?

game (not the definitve name, as you might have guessed) is an educative game, made for teaching Python loops to
beginners.
Contrary to most coding games, the player controls its avatar using his keyboard arrows. The code they produce allow
them to modify their environment (e.g. by building bridges).
It was originally made during a university project by three UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne) students. If
you can read french, here is the full project report : .
You can also read (in english) the [full technical documentation](https://google.com).

## How does it work ?

The game is coded in Python, using mainly arcade (for the regular game window) and kivy (for the code input). Having
the game run in python makes it easier to run the code injected by the user. For details, see the technical
documentation (href  missing).
