# Froggy and Frankie take a nice walk 

## What is it ?

Froggy and Frankie take a nice walk is an educative game, made for teaching Python loops to beginners.
Contrary to most coding games, the player controls its avatar using his keyboard arrows. The code they produce allow
them to modify their environment (e.g. by building bridges).
It was originally made during a university project by three UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne) students. If you can read french, the full report is the docs/report folder.
You can also read (in english) the full technical documentation available in the docs/build folder.

## How does it work ?

The game is coded in Python, using mainly arcade (for the regular game window) and kivy (for the code input). Having
the game run in python makes it easier to run the code injected by the user. For details, see the technical
documentation (href  missing).
