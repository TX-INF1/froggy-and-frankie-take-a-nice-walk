game (not the definitve name, as you might have guessed) is an educative game, made for teaching Python loops to
beginners.
Contrary to most coding games, the player controls its avatar using his keyboard arrows. The code they produce allow
them to modify their environment (e.g. by building bridges).
It was originally made during a university project by three UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne) students.

The game is coded in Python, using mainly arcade (for the regular game window) and kivy (for the code input). Having
the game run in python makes it easier to run the code injected by the user. For details, see the technical
documentation (href  missing).

The project is no longer in developement. However, anyone can contribute to it ! Please feel free to contact us if you
want to know how to get started.
